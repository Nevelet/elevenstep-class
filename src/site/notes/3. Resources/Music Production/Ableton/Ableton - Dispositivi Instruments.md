## Descrizione

I dispositivi Instrument, ci permettono di riprodurre un suono o generarlo da zero. Questo tipi di dispositivi, possono essere collocato solo in [[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Traccia MIDI\|Tracce MIDI]]

**Esistono due tipi di dispositivi instrument:**

- Synths: Questi dispositivi generano suoni da zero. Possono essere utilizzati per creare una varietà di suoni, tra cui pad, lead e bassi.

- Samplers: Questi dispositivi riproducono campioni di suoni reali. Possono essere utilizzati per creare suoni organici o per aggiungere texture alle tue produzioni.


## Lista completa

- **Impulse**
	- a traditional drum triggering instrument which allows the user to define a kit of up to eight drum sounds, each based on a single sample. There are a number of effects available such as basic equalization, attack, decay, pitch shift, etc. Once the kit is defined, rhythms and beats are created through Live's MIDI sequencer.
- **[[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Simpler\|Simpler]]**
	- a basic [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)) instrument. It functions using a single audio sample, applying simple effects, and envelopes, finally applying pitch transformations in the form of [Granular synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_synthesis). In this case, incoming MIDI does not trigger drums as it does in _Impulse_, but selects the final pitch of the sample, with C3 playing the sample at its original pitch.
- **[[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Drum Rack\|Drum Rack]]**
	- a sampler for drums. MIDI notes trigger individual "Simplers" so rather than triggering one sample at multiple pitches, individual samples are triggered at predefined pitches, as is suitable for MIDI drum programming. As is usual with Ableton almost anything can be drag dropped to or from the drum racks; for example, one can drop an audio clip or any MIDI device onto a drum rack note.
- **Instrument [[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Racks\|Rack]]**
	- allows the user to combine multiple instruments and effects into a single device, allowing for split and layered sounds with customized macro controls.
- **Analog**
	- simulates an [analog synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer).
- **Bass**
	- a monophonic virtual analog bass synthesizer.
- **Collision**
	- a mallet [percussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument) [physical modelling synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis).
- **Drum Synths**
	- 8 devices for creating drum and percussion sounds via synthesis.
- **Electric**
	- an [electric piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_piano) instrument.
- [[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Operator\|Operator]]
	- [**Operator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Operator)
	- an [FM synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis).
- **Poli**
	- a virtual analog synthesizer that combines [subtractive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis) and [FM synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis)
- **[[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Sampler\|Sampler]]**
	- an enhanced [sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)).
- **Tension**
	- a string [physical modelling synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis).
- **[[3. Resources/Music Production/Ableton/Ableton - Wavetable\|Wavetable]]**
	- a [wavetable synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavetable_synthesizer) featuring two oscillators and re-mappable modulation sources.
- Meld (Ableton 12)
	- Sintetizzatore bi-timbrico
- Granulator III (Ableton 12)
