Pluck = Pizzicare. Bassi non lunghi, ma con note corte, pizzicate appunto
Wobble = oscillare. Bassi che oscillano e non sono fermi

## Tips & Tricks

- **Phase Randomization:** Quando si fanno dei layers con gli oscillatori, a volte possono creare delle cancellazioni nel corso del tempo, quindi potresti provare ad abbassare Phase Randomization, in questo modo la fase non cambia nel tempo. 

## Range Bass

- Sub-Bass
- Mid-Bass
- Upper-Bass
